# Package Asterix

Asterix is a package to simulate high contrast-correction algorithns with various coronagraphs, developped at LESIA / Paris Observatory.

Due to the continually developing nature of this package, we recommend you use the current version of the code on GitHub and keep it updated. To install the most up-to-date developer version, clone this repository if you havenâ€™t already:

$ git clone git@github.com:johanmazoyer/Asterix.git

This clones the repository. Once the repository is cloned onto your computer, 'cd' into it and run the setup file:

$ python setup.py develop
