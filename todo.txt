Ideas for Asterix improvements

Other propagation methods :
    -   FALCO trick

Other coronagraphs (Vortex, apodisers)
Other estimation algorithms (SCC)



Remaining important problems
- gradiant for Coffee, which heavily depends on the model but needs
to be automtically updated when the model is changed.
probaby done in COFFEE estimator initialization. but to be re-discussed later

- matrix recalculation should be done in correction class ?

Maybe the correction loop can be another function of Corrector that use Corrector.toDM_voltages.
Something like  Corrector.Correction_loop(Initial_EF_field). This function can allow to
define separatly the problematic of gains, matrix recalculation, etc.

Correction with repeated Jacobian

polychromatic correction: inside of the correction
polychromatic estimation: inside of the estimation function and can send, single WL, multiple WL or large bandwidth
                                estimate with keyword to explain.
