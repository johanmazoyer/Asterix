Asterix: Simulate your High-Contrast Instruments
=======================================================

Asterix is a python based library for simulating high contrast instruments and testbeds with a strong
focus on focal plane wavefront sensing and correction algorithms.

Asterix is publicaly available on `GitHub <https://github.com/johanmazoyer/Asterix>`_ and all contributions are welcome!

The development of Asterix was led by Axel Potier (2017-2020) and Johan Mazoyer (since 2020)
